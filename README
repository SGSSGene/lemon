LEMON - a Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks
=====================================================================

LEMON is an open source library written in C++. It provides
easy-to-use implementations of common data structures and algorithms
in the area of optimization and helps implementing new ones. The main
focus is on graphs and graph algorithms, thus it is especially
suitable for solving design and optimization problems of
telecommunication networks. To achieve wide usability its data
structures and algorithms provide generic interfaces.


Attention
=========

This is a snapshot of the original LEMON version 1.3.1 repository
(http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/hg/lemon) from 1st of March 2018.
It contains only the source code directory and a modified config.h
file that allows header-only usage by SeqAn.
Issues should be solely reported to the original LEMON repository.
